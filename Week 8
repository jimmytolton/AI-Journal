Week 8 AI Journal Entry

This week I used AI to help give me a better understanding of inheritance and polymorphism.
I mainly used ChatGPT for the assistance on this topic because I will have to be able to
implement these concepts into the project. I did not use AI directly to complete
the exercises rather I used it to explain the concepts and to explain errors I made along the way.
