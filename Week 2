This week I used AI to mainly clarify some of the excercises. The final exercise was especially difficult for me. I used ChatGPT to give me a refresher on libraries and all
the different functions which allowed me to then write the proper code. I did not use google gemini or claude this week only because I didn't have to comapre anything in the 
exercises.
