Week 4 AI Journal Entry

I used AI this week to give me a refresher on the steps when creating classes and subjects. One thing that AI really helped me with was the _init_ function
which was used throughout the week 4 exercises. AI helped me to explain the use of the _init_ function where then I was able to apply it to the excersises.
I didn't directly use AI to give me the answers to the exercises but more to give me abetter understanding of how to complete them. I think the exercises this
week were very helpful and will be important for completing the the first project this week.
