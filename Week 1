Week 1:
This week I mainly used AI to help explain some of the python methods in the excersises. I used AI to help refresh my knowledge in boolean functions as I haven't used them in a while.
I mainly used ChatGPT for these explantions but I also tried copilot which I thought was also very helpful. I have yet to use gemini but I plan to use it next week just so I can compare
it to other platforms such as ChatGPT and Copilot. Both ChatGPT and Copilt gave me similar responses when given the same prompts. As a group we plan to use AI to help us structure and
organize ideas for our project charter.
